Programmed a game using Unity and C#. The player can roll a marble on the 3D board to collect as many stars as possible. The marble accelerates in the corresponding direction when an arrow key is pressed, and stars are randomly generated on the board. A scoreboard keeps track of how many stars the user collects. Obstacles randomly fall onto the board to block the path of the marble and increase the diï¬ƒculty level.
